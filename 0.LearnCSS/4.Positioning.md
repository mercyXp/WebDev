# :dart:Positioning
CSS positioning allows you to control where elements appear on a web page. This guide explains the different positioning methods with simple examples, so you can easily style your layouts.

## Static
- Default behavior of all elements.
- Elements appear in the normal document flow.
### Example:
```html
<div style="position: static; background: lightblue;">Static Positioning</div>
```

### Relative
- The element stays in the normal flow but can be shifted relative to its normal position using `top`, `right`, `bottom`, or `left`.
```html
<div style="position: relative; top: 20px; left: 30px; background: lightgreen;">Relative Positioning</div>
```
- `top`: 20px; moves the element 20px down.
- `left`: 30px; moves it 30px to the right.

### Absolute
- The element is removed from the normal flow and positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with position: relative, absolute, or fixed).
- If no ancestor is positioned, it defaults to the viewport.
```html
<div style="position: relative; background: lightgray; padding: 50px;">
  Parent (Relative)
  <div style="position: absolute; top: 10px; right: 10px; background: orange;">Absolute Positioning</div>
</div>
```
- The orange box is positioned 10px from the top-right corner of the gray parent.
### Fixed
- The element is removed from the flow and positioned relative to the viewport (browser window).
- It does not move even when you scroll.
```html

<div style="position: fixed; bottom: 10px; right: 10px; background: pink;">Fixed Positioning</div>
```
- The pink box stays 10px from the bottom-right corner of the screen, regardless of scrolling.
### Sticky
- The element toggles between relative and fixed positioning based on the scroll.
- Sticks to a defined position within a container when scrolling.
```html
<div style="height: 200px; overflow-y: scroll; border: 1px solid black;">
  <div style="position: sticky; top: 0; background: yellow;">Sticky Positioning</div>
  <p>Scroll down to see the sticky effect.</p>
  <p>More content...</p>
</div>
```
- The yellow box stays at the top of the container while scrolling until it reaches the container's bottom.
### Z-index
- Use z-index to control the stacking order of overlapping elements.
- Elements with higher z-index values appear on top.
```html
<div style="position: relative; z-index: 1; background: blue; color: white;">Layer 1</div>
<div style="position: relative; z-index: 2; background: red; color: white; margin-top: -20px;">Layer 2</div>
- The red box (Layer 2) appears on top because its `z-index` is higher than the blue box (Layer 1).
