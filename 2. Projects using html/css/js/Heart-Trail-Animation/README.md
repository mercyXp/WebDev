## Project description
- Our project involves creating a `heart rate animation` that responds to mouse movement in the browser. 
- As the mouse moves, hearts of varying colors and sizes will appear on the screen. 
- Keyframe queries will modify the opacity, size, and hue of the hearts. 
- To track the mouse's position in the browser, we'll use JavaScript. 
- With this information, we'll position the heart in the exact location of the cursor. 
- This interactive feature will personalize the user experience and respond to their movements in real-time. 
- By combining these elements, we'll develop an engaging and dynamic animation that captures the user's attention and provides a fun and interactive experience on the webpage.
